Welcome to CyberCraft, a pedagogic serious game on computer system security.
The game focuses on presenting you with common security attack as well as the defensive approaches against them.
Click on the downward arrow near the right bottom of the screen to proceed with next page. Alternatively, you can use shortcut key pageUp and pageDown for the navigation.^

In some scenarios, you will play as intruder, who exploits offensive acts to impair the rival and compromise the target assets.
In some other scenarios, you will take the role as defender, who uses defensive techniques to protect company assets, while also keeping the company's server running.
Note that, the game is only a simplified simulation, without covering all the possible attacks or defences. In the real life, the situation could be much more complexed than what is presented here.^

This piece of tutorial in particular, mainly concentrates on the control in the "hall", where you usually gather information or even hints about the upcoming challenge.^

There will be some NPCs (e.g. boss, technician, desk clerk) in the hall of the organization. You can talk to them by clicking on them.
In the top-right corner, there is a door. You can abandon your mission and exit from the door.^

Enough talk. I think you prefer a real parctice much more, right? Let go!
Try to give the company a good impression of you!
