Congratulations! You have defended the company from cyber threat!

^Note that the intruder may use a combination of attacks. It's possible that the intruder uses first attacks to cripple your defense, while the last attack to really compromise your assets.

^If you don't defend from those attacks of DoS category, you could have hard time with the clients, and you may not get enough resource to set up the defense. If you don't defend from attacks on the assets... You will loss.
In formal game scenarios, there will be more than one path to attack the assets. If you have enough resources, you should block all the paths; but if you have limited resource, then you can only take a bet.

^Then, to obtain information about the rival's possible actions, you should ask the NPCs in the hall, or take a look at the computer during the rival's round.
