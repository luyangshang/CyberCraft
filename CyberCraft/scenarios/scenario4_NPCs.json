You probably have heard of ArtificialCore as a company researching on a strong AIs. ^Traced from your last cracked messages, we finally discovered that ArtificialCore is the one who is secretly developing AI for the war machine. ^Yeah, I'm also shocked, just like you. ^Undoubtedly, we will fight ArtificialCore from now on. ^Intelligence reports that, a weak point has been found on ArtificialCore's telecommuters and those on travel. ^These bars and houses marked are where ArtificialCore's telecommutor usually stays, and this airport is where its managers usually travels. ^By going to these places, you can creep near the victim. ^Use your knowledge, especially the techniques on wireless networks, you can fool the victim, and get something of the company. ^Tell me when you are going to depart."
