Congratulations! You have successfully disarranged ArtificialCore's system.

^After the disarrangement, ArtificialCore has called all its telecommuters and those that could have business travels at the headquarter, and have trained them with security tips. This is right choice to fix the problem immediately, but because of this overall and intensive training, their intelligent war machine project is suspended, just as HackIt expected.

^Tips: connecting to public free Wi-Fi, and you run the risk of potential attack.
If you really need to use the public wifi, avoid access important websites as much as possible.
