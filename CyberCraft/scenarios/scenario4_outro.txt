Congratulations! You have successfully disarranged ArtificialCore's system.

^After the disarrangement, ArtificialCore has called all its telecommuters and those that could have business travels to the headquarter, and have them nicely trained in security. This is right choice to fix the problem immediately, but because of this overall and intensive training, their intelligent war machine project is suspended, just as HackIt expected.

^Tips: connecting to public free Wi-Fi, and you run the risk of potential attack.
If you really need to use the public wifi, avoid accessing important websites as much as possible.
