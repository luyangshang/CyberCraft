Whereas your senior still insists that we reinforce on wireless security... ^I don't know why. So, if you have some technical questions, go to ask him. Yeah, right there, topright corner near the exit. ^I'm sure that you will be more happy to discuss with him."

The latter is not a cracking passwords, but an abuse of the session cookie."
